# Introduction
This is my documentation dedicated to my take on some aoi.js stuff! It was mostly created to avoid having my guides lost one day while also helping aoi.js people on how to improve themselves at bot development!

# Note
This documentation is unofficial and it is not advised to use it as main help for any support server related to aoi.js. The reason is that, some support servers prefer having their own guides instead and this was not made either to encourage unofficial docs. If they allow this site to be used then i don't think you're gonna be in trouble with the staff.

# Guides
Some guides here are from aoi.js forums. They're just listed here to avoid resulting in those being lost to time. If you're coming from aoi.js official forums then you will notice some of those are exactly the same with nearly no differences at all.

Consider this documentation as some sort of previews of what's to come from me as there're things that aren't posted anywhere else!
