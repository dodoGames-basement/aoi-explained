Today i'm changing the name of this project to Dodo aoi.js Stuff! The reason for this is to make the name actually make sense as most of the pages i include are dedicated to my aoi.js stuff for you to learn!

I also do not want to confuse people between this website and the official [documentation](https://aoi.js.org/) about aoi.js hence the name change! It's most likely for the best as i had mistakes in the past when i made this site with Gitbook.

There are also plans on more guides such as toggle buttons and much more! For now, you can check the current guides and you will start to see the new ones once i have time to actually work on them. Nevertheless, have a nice day! Cya in the next update!
